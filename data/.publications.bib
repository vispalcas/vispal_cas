Previous studies have shown that aging impairs a variety of visual functions, but how aging affects binocular vision is still unclear. In this study, we measured three typical binocular functions—binocular combination, binocular rivalry, and stereo vision—to investigate aging-related effects on binocular vision in a relatively large sample (48 younger adults and 27 older adults) with normal or corrected-to-normal distance vision and no ophthalmological and mental diseases. We found that there were no consistent aging-related declines in binocular vision, with the worst effect on alternation frequency in binocular rivalry and no effect on binocular phase combination and stereo vision tested by Titmus. In addition, aging changed the correlation pattern among some of these binocular functions. These results reflected (at least partially) different aging-related mechanism(s) in binocular vision.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Depression in children and adolescents has become a serious public health problem worldwide. The objectives of this study were twofold: first, to investigate the status of depression among children and adolescents on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the highest plateau in the world, with an average altitude of more than 4200 m (13,776 feet), and second, to examine the associations among prosocial behavior, resilience, and depression. A cross-sectional study was conducted among children and adolescents from Yushu Prefecture on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. A total of 11,160 participants aged 10-17 years (Mage = 14.34 years, SD = 1.77; 51.4\% girls) were included. Self-reported depression, resilience, and prosocial behavior were assessed. The prevalence of depression was 29.2\% in the current study. Higher levels of prosocial behavior were significantly associated with lower levels of depression (beta = -0.25, p \&lt; 0.001). Furthermore, resilience significantly moderated the relationship between prosocial behavior and depression (beta = -0.08, p \&lt; 0.001); that is, resilience enhanced the protective role of prosocial behavior in depression. These findings indicate that resilience may play an important role in the associations between prosocial behavior and depression, which suggests that improving resilience is essential for the prevention and intervention of depression among children and adolescents on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Perceptual learning, the improved sensitivity via repetitive practice, is a universal phenomenon in vision and its neural mechanisms remain controversial. A central question is which stage of processing is changed after training. To answer this question, we measured the contrast response functions and electroencephalography (EEG) before and after ten daily sessions of contrast detection training. Behavioral results showed that training substantially improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. The learning effect was significant at the trained condition and partially transferred to control conditions. Event-related potential (ERP) results showed that training reduced the latency in both early and late ERPs at the trained condition. Specifically, contrast-gain-related changes were observed in the latency of P1, N1-P2 complex, and N2, which reflects neural changes across the early, middle, and high-level sensory stages. Meanwhile, response-gain-related changes were found in the latency of N2, which indicates stimulus-independent effect in higher-level stages. In sum, our findings indicate that learning leads to changes across different processing stages and the extent of learning and transfer may depend on the specific stage of information processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent clinical trials failed to endorse dichoptic training for amblyopia treatment. Here, we proposed an alternative training strategy that focused on reducing signal threshold contrast in the amblyopic eye under a constant and high noise contrast in the fellow eye (HNC), and compared it to a typical dichoptic strategy that aimed at increasing the tolerable noise contrast in the fellow eye (i.e., TNC strategy). We recruited 16 patients with amblyopia and divided them into two groups. Eight patients in Group 1 received the HNC training, while the other eight patients in Group 2 performed the TNC training first (Phase 1) and then crossed over to the HNC training (Phase 2). We measured contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs) separately in the amblyopic and fellow eyes when the untested eye viewed mean luminance (monocularly unmasked) or noise stimuli (dichoptically masked) before and after training at a particular frequency. The area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) of masked and unmasked conditions, and dichoptic gain (the ratio of AULCSF of masked to unmasked condition) were calculated for each eye. We found that both dichoptic training paradigms substantially improved masked CSF, dichoptic gain, and visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. As opposed to the TNC paradigm, the HNC training produced stronger effects on masked CSFs, stereoacuity, dichoptic gain, and visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. Interestingly, the second-phase HNC training in Group 2 also induced further improvement in the masked contrast sensitivity and AULCSF in the amblyopic eye. We concluded that the HNC training strategy was more effective than the TNC training paradigm. Future design for dichoptic training should not only focus on increasing the tolerable noise contrast in the fellow eye but should also \&quot;nurture\&quot; the amblyopic eye under normal binocular viewing conditions and sustained interocular suppression.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Developing expertise in any field usually requires acquisition of a wide range of skills. Most current studies on perceptual learning have focused on a single task and concluded that learning is quite specific to the trained task, and the ubiquitous individual differences reflect random fluctuations across subjects. Whether there exists a general learning ability that determines individual learning performance across multiple tasks remains largely unknown. In a large-scale perceptual learning study with a wide range of training tasks, we found that initial performance, task, and individual differences all contributed significantly to the learning rates across the tasks. Most importantly, we were able to extract both a task-specific but subject-invariant component of learning, that accounted for 38.6\% of the variance, and a subject-specific but task-invariant perceptual learning ability, that accounted for 36.8\% of the variance. The existence of a general perceptual learning ability across multiple tasks suggests that individual differences in perceptual learning are not \&quot;noise\&quot;; rather, they reflect the variability of learning ability across individuals. These results could have important implications for selecting potential trainees in occupations that require perceptual expertise and designing better training protocols to improve the efficiency of clinical rehabilitation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Visual functions decline with age, but how aging degrades visual functions remains controversial. In the current study, the mechanisms underlying age-related visual declines were examined psychophysically. We developed an efficient method to quickly explore contrast sensitivity as a function of nine spatial frequencies at three levels of external noise in both young and old subjects. Fifty-two young and twenty-six old subjects have been screened for ophthalmological and mental diseases and participated in the experiment. Contrast sensitivity varied significantly with spatial frequency, age, and level of external noise. By adopting a nonlinear observer model, we decomposed contrast sensitivity into inefficiencies in internal additive noise, internal multiplicative noise, perceptual template gain, and/ or system non-linearity. Model analysis revealed that aging impacts both internal additive noise and perceptual template gain, and such age-related degradation is tuned to spatial frequency, which is also a good predictor to discriminate old from young. The quick characterization of contrast sensitivity functions at different noise levels and the accompanying analysis developed in the current study may have profound application in other clinical populations.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a well-established non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been widely applied to modulate cortical excitability in human brain. The results of previous tDCS studies on modulating contrast sensitivity, one of the most fundamental visual functions, were mixed. Objective: We aim to systematically investigate the effects of anodal tDCS on contrast sensitivity functions (CSF), evaluate the responsiveness explanation of tDCS effects, and discuss results along with measurement precision. Methods: We designed a single-blinded, sham-controlled within-subject study. Twenty-seven healthy adult subjects received three sets of 15 min tDCS (two 2-mA anodal and one sham) that delivered at Oz, with CSF measured before and after each tDCS stimulation. Experimental sessions were separated by at least twenty-four hours. CSF was assessed with a Bayesian procedure that accurately estimated CSF within minutes. The anodal tDCS-induced effect was gauged with the change in CSF after stimulation; responsiveness was indexed by correlation between CSF changes in different stimulation; precision was calculated from resampling. Results: Our results indicated that neither the first nor the second session anodal tDCS altered the CSF significantly. Responsiveness was inconsistent between the two anodal sessions, indicating the usual responder/non-responder explanation of tDCS effects was unconvincing. Precision was less than 2 dB and constant throughout the whole experiment. Conclusions: The anodal tDCS, at least with two sessions, has no effect on modulating CSF. The absence of anodal tDCS effect on CSF was not due to subject\&\#39;s responsiveness to tDCS or measurement precision. More studies were needed to determine the optimal vision modulation configuration.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To report the implementation of digital imaging in ocular screening of all newborns in multiple centres in China and to describe the abnormal findings of fundus examination, we did the cross-sectional study. Methods Fundus examinations were performed on newborns within the 42 days after birth using a RetCam wide-field digital imaging system. Digital images of the posterior pole, superior, nasal and temporal retinal fields of each participant were taken. All newborns were from eights centres across China from January 2009 to July 2017. Results A total of 199 851 newborns were included in the study. We detected 18 198 (9.11\%) abnormal cases. The most frequent abnormality was severe retinal haemorrhage (RH) found in 12 810 cases (6.41\%). The other anomalies included familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, abnormal fundus pigmentation, subconjunctival haemorrhage, choroidal coloboma, idiopathic retinal venous tortuosity, exudative changes and other anomalies with uncertain identities. Conclusion This large-scale study of newborn fundus examination showed a relatively high prevalence of ocular abnormalities. Hundreds of neonates with rare disorders that severely impair ocular health were also detected at an early age. The long-term impact of other anomalies including RHs on the ocular system should be investigated by a perspective study. Our study suggested that fundus examination of newborns can play a beneficial role in ocular health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Intensive monocular perceptual learning can improve visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and vernier acuity in the amblyopic eye in adults with amblyopia. It is however not clear how much monocular training can enhance binocular visual functions. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate effects of monocular training on a variety of binocular functions. Nineteen anisometropic amblyopes (18.5 +/- 1.26 yrs, mean +/- s.e.) were trained in a grating contrast detection task near each individual's cutoff spatial frequency for 6-10 days (630 trials/day). Visual acuity, stereoacuity, monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity functions (CSF), binocular phase combination and binocular rivalry were tested before and after training. Although monocular training can improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and eye dominance of the amblyopic eye, the magnitudes of improvements did not correlate with each other; the impact of monocular training on binocular phase combination was not significant. The results strongly suggest that structured monocular and binocular training is needed to fully recover deficient visual functions in anisometropic amblyopia. (C) 2017 The Author(s).

The gold standard of a successful amblyopia treatment is full recovery of visual acuity (VA) in the amblyopic eye, but there has been no systematic study on both monocular and binocular visual functions. In this research, we aimed to quantify visual qualities with a variety of perceptual tasks in subjects with treated amblyopia. We found near stereoacuity and pAE dominance in binocular rivalry in \&quot;treated\&quot; amblyopia were largely comparable to those of normal subjects. CSF of the pAE remained deficient in high spatial frequencies. The binocular contrast summation ratio is significantly lower than normal standard. The interocular balance point is 34\%, indicating that contrast in pAE is much less effective as the same contrast in pFE in binocular phase combination. Although VA, stereoacuity and binocular rivalry at low spatial frequency in treated amblyopes were normal or nearly normal, the pAE remained \&quot;lazy\&quot; in high frequency domain, binocular contrast summation, and interocular phase combination. Our results suggest that structured monocular and binocular training are necessary to fully recover deficient functions in amblyopia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The contrast sensitivity function (CSF), delineating contrast sensitivity over a wide range of spatial frequencies, provides a comprehensive characterization of spatial vision and a sensitive test for many physiological and pathological processes. A precise CSF measurement tool for the aging population is of great theoretical and practical importance. In the current study, we tested whether the assumptions of the newly developed quick CSF method were valid and whether it can rapidly, reliably, and effectively evaluate CSFs in the aging population. The quick CSF method combines Bayesian adaptive inference with an information gain strategy to directly estimate four parameters that define the observer\&\#39;s CSF. Eighteen young and twenty-five old observers participated in the evaluation of the quick CSF method. All observers were screened for ophthalmological and mental diseases. Our results showed that the CSFs derived from the quick CSF method well matched with those from the traditional. method, with excellent test-retest reliability. More importantly, the quick CSF method can accurately detect the difference of CSFs between the young and old groups. Aging significantly degrades contrast sensitivity. The quick CSF method demonstrates great potentials for both laboratory research and clinical applications in the aging population.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}
PURPOSE: Processing and telling time, or time perception, is vital for the survival of any organism. A variety of spatial cues have been found to be effective in modulating observers\&rsquo; time perception. Here, we investigated the effect of synchronization, a form of temporal cue, on the perceived duration of visual stimuli in which spatial cues were largely controlled.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
METHODS AND RESULTS: Stimuli were 100 non-overlapping Gabor patches moving in one of two directions that orthogonal to their orientations. Synchronization of Gabor patches were defined by entropy and correlation; entropy refers to the probability of moving direction change and correlation refers to the likelihood that all Gabor elements reverse their motion directions simultaneously. In Experiment 1, nineteen observers performed a duration discrimination task that included four pairs of stimuli that differed in entropy and correlation and found that stimuli with high synchronization were perceived significantly shorter (by {\textasciitilde}50ms) than random but otherwise identical stimuli of the same duration. This contraction effect couldn\&rsquo;t be explained by change in perceived speed (Experiment 2). Varying the display duration from 350 to 1050ms didn\&rsquo;t significantly affect the magnitude of perceived contraction (Experiment 3). Furthermore, we found no significant difference in both appearance and disappearance detection times to stimuli (Experiment 4), ruling out the possibility of different detection time with stimuli of different synchronization factors.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings suggest that synchronization can also effectively modulate time perception, possibly acting via slowing down the pacemaker, an essential part of the internal clock.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}
目的：视野缺损是一种常见的眼科疾病，眼部炎症、外伤以及视觉通路病变等均会造成不同类型的视野缺损。目前临床上对视野受损的视觉能力评估主要依赖于视野计，但有不少研究表明视野计可能大大低估了患者的视觉能力。然而，临床上并无用于对已缺损视野功能进行客观而有效地评估和干预的技术和方法。本研究利用视觉心理物理学研究中已被研究得相对比较清晰的记忆视觉掩蔽技术(memory masking）去定量评估受损视野的残留功能水平。同时，对于受损视野仍有残留功能的病人，采用知觉学习方法来尝试对其缺损的视野进行恢复。{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
方法：实验一采用记忆掩蔽范式对偏盲患者缺损视野的功能进行评估。通过对比掩蔽刺激在受损视野和完整视野两种情况下掩蔽效应的差异去推断受损视野的残留功能状态。 实验二采用知觉学习训练方法，利用光栅朝向辨别任务来对偏盲病人进行训练。在训练中，首先每一试次会同时呈现两个对比度相同且位置相对固定的光栅，让被试判断这两个光栅的朝向是否一致，通过阶梯法控制光栅的对比度。当在初始位置上朝向辨别任务的对比度下降到某一水平，则改变刺激呈现位置，逐步由中央向外周扩展。被试每天训练1-2次，每名被试训练3-6个月。{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
结果：实验一的结果发现，被诊断为偏盲的患者，其缺损视野仍观测到稳定的掩蔽效应，表明传统测量视野的方法低估了患者的视觉功能，受损视野仍存在着功能完整的细胞，受损视野有变好的可能。实验二的结果发现，经过3-6个月的训练，4名偏盲被试双眼平均提高1.87dB, 其中左眼平均提高2.38dB，右眼平均提高1.36dB。{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
结论：结果提示，视野缺损病人的偏盲侧依然具有残余的视功能，仅用视野计评估视野会严重低估患者的视觉功能。利用知觉学习的训练方法可以改善视野缺损病人的受损状况。{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

PURPOSE: Despite training makes perfect improvement in most perceptual tasks, the neural and functional mechanisms of perceptual learning are still under debate. Here we used a combination of psychophysics, event-related potentials (ERPs), and quantitative modeling to explicitly link learning-induced behavioral improvements with changes in neural activities.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
METHODS: Twenty subjects underwent ten sessions of training to identify the orientation of a peripherally presented sinewave grating. A set of psychophysics and ERP measurements at different retinal locations, contrast levels, and eyes were conducted before and after training.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
RESULTS: We found that training substantially improved visual acuity and contrast sensitivity functions, increased the amplitude, and decreased the latency of the ERP components at the trained location. The learning effect was particularly pronounced around the trained condition, consistent with previous findings. Modeling analysis revealed that training led to changes in both contrast, slope and response gains for different ERP component, and learning induced changes encompassed different sensory gain from the early to the late ERP components. Moreover, the learning effects and improvements in latency at the trained location were largely retained over a three-month period.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a model of PL in which neuronal plasticity occurs at both early and late ERP components, but with different mechanisms.{\textless}br /{\textgreater}
The results of the late ERP components may reflect top-down effects such as attention involved in the processing of the stimuli which amplify the increase of the amplitude or decrease the latency of the late ERP components.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

METHODS: Sixteen treated amblyopes with similar visual acuity in two eyes participated in this study. Stereoacuity, monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity functions (CSF), binocular phase combination, and pAE dominance in binocular rivalry were measured. Three indices were derived to quantify sensory eye dominance: (1) binocular contrast summation ratio, (2) interocular balance point in binocular phase combination, and (3) percentage of pAE dominance in rivalry.
RESULTS: Stereoacuity and pAE dominance in binocular rivalry in "treated" amblyopia were largely comparable to those of normal subjects. CSF of the pAE remained deficient in high spatial frequencies. The binocular contrast summation ratio is significantly lower than normal standard. The interocular balance point is 34\%, indicating that contrast in pAE is only 34\% as effective as the same contrast in pFE in binocular phase combination.

Twenty-seven healthy adult subjects received three sets of 15-min tDCS (two 2-mA anodal and one sham), with CSF measured before and after tDCS stimulation. The tDCS were delivered at Oz and separated by at least twenty-four hours. The results indicated that one-session anodal tDCS didn’t alter the CSF’s significantly; an extra session of tDCS led to improved CSF, most around mid-frequency. These results were discussed within the measurement precision. Our findings also suggested that the cortical excitation elicited by external electrical stimulation might be cumulative.},

To investigate the frequency-dependent changes in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) in patients with Wilson\&\#39;s disease (WD). Resting-state function magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) were employed to measure the amplitude of ALFF in 28 patients with WD and 27 matched normal controls. Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) and slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz) frequency bands were analyzed. Apart from the observation of atrophy in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, occipital gyrus, frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, and paracentral lobule, we also found widespread differences in ALFF of the two bands in the medial frontal gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, insula, basal ganglia, hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, and thalamus bilaterally. Compared to normal controls, WD patients had increased ALFF in the posterior lobe of the cerebellum, inferior temporal gyrus, brain stem, basal ganglia, and decreased ALFF in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum and medial frontal gyrus. Specifically, we observed that the ALFF abnormalities in the cerebellum and middle frontal gyrus were greater in the slow-5 than in the slow-4 band. Correlation analysis showed consistently positive correlations between urinary copper excretion (Cu), serum ceruloplasmin (CP) and ALFFs in the cerebellum. Our study suggests the accumulation of copper profoundly impaired intrinsic brain activity and the impairments seem to be frequency-dependent. These results provide further insights into the understanding of the pathophysiology of WD.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

方法：使用快速对比敏感度（quick Contrast sensitivity Function qCSF）和外部噪音相结合的测量方法, 对接受角膜塑形术的近视患者进行视功能的测量。外部噪音分为高中低三个水平(白噪声, \&mu;=0 and \&sigma;\&isin;[0 .08 0.24]), 频率范围从0.5到8周/度。测量分为4次, 首先在塑形前分别戴框架眼镜矫正的状态和裸眼状态进行2次的塑形眼视力和对比敏感度测量；其次在塑形后一周和一个月左右分别重复对塑形眼进行测量。{\textless}br /{\textgreater}

	abstract = {Purpose: Although numerous studies have shown that perceptual learning can improve deficient visual functions in adults with amblyopia, the efficacy of perceptual learning in treating children with amblyopia has rarely been investigated. Here, we designed a child-friendly, individualized adaptive vision training (iAVT) based on a visual training procedure originally developed to train adults with amblyopia (Zhou et al., 2006) to evaluate e?ects of perceptual learning in children with amblyopia.
Methods: Nineteen amblyopic children (7.78±2.73 yrs) were trained with the iAVT in a filtered letter E orientation identification task near their individual cutoff frequency for 8 sessions, with 300 trials or 30 minutes per session. Contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and visual acuity in both the amblyopic and fellow eyes, and stereo acuity were assessed before and after training. CSF was measured using the qCSF procedure (Lesmes, Lu, Baek, \& Albright, 2010). Each qCSF assessment took less than ?ve minutes.
Results: Training signi?cantly improved visual acuity (2 lines) and contrast sensitivity (53.9\%, from 13.01 to 20.02, p{\textless} 0.0001) in the amblyopic eye, stereo acuity (80.8\%, from 606 to 116.2, p{\textless} 0.0001), and contrast sensitivity (24.7\%, from 28.4 to 35.4, p{\textless} 0.01) in the fellow eye. The magnitudes of improvements were correlated with pre-training visual deficits: The worse the pre-training measure was, the greater the improvements. Interestingly, we found no significant correlation among the magnitudes of improvements in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity (all p {\textgreater} 0.39).
Conclusions: These results demonstrate the merit of perceptual learning in treating children with amblyopia. Consistent with results in adults with amblyopia (Xi, Jia, Feng, Lu, \& Huang, 2014), the lack of correlation among improvements in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity suggests that structured monocular and binocular treatments are necessary to fully restore de?cient visual functions in amblyopia.},

	abstract = {Amblyopia screening during childhood is critical for early detection and successful treatment. In the current study, we develop and evaluate a screening method that exploits the imbalanced interocular inhibition between amblyopic and fellow eyes. In nineteen subjects with anisometropic amblyopia and twenty-two age-matched subjects with myopia, we measured the area under the contrast sensitivity functions (AUCSFs) in eight monocular conditions defined by the tested eye (left, right), patching of the untested eye (translucent, opaque), and refractive status (corrected, uncorrected). For each tested eye, we defined the inhibition index as the ratio between the AUCSF values obtained in the translucent and opaque patching conditions of the untested eye. To evaluate the screening potential of the inhibition index, we compared results from patients with amblyopia and myopia. With and without optical correction, the index was significantly lower in the amblyopic eye than in the fellow eye of the amblyopic subjects and both eyes of the myopic subjects. No significant difference was found among the two eyes of the myopic subjects and the fellow eyes of the amblyopic subjects. With the inhibition index as the predictor, a logistic regression model successfully discriminated amblyopic eyes from myopic eyes with 100\% accuracy in the uncorrected condition. In the corrected condition, with the inhibition index and interocular visual acuity difference as predictors, amblyopic eyes were likewise discriminated from myopic eyes with 100\% accuracy. This pattern of CSF changes, caused by the different patching modes of the untested eye, provides a potential CSF signature to discriminate anisometropic amblyopia from myopia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results suggest that neural connections in the amblyopic visual cortex, at least in V1, may have profoundly developed to represent high spatial frequency information. The demonstration of extant neural connections for high spatial frequencies may have important implications for the development of training protocols for amblyopia treatment. Our paradigm may also serve as a non-invasive probe to diagnose the status of neural connections in other visual deficits.},

We found that, although training generated the largest improvements around the trained frequency, contrast sensitivity over a broad range of spatial frequencies also improved, with a 4.09-octave bandwidth of perceptual learning, exhibiting specificity to the trained spatial frequency as well as a relatively large degree of generalization. The improvements in the modulation sensitivity function (MSF) were not significantly different between the trained and untrained eyes. Furthermore, training did not significantly change subjects\&\#39; ability in detecting firstorder gratings. Our results suggest that perceptual learning in second-order detection might occur at the postchannel level in binocular neurons, possibly through reducing the internal noise of the visual system.},

	abstract = {Visual performance is jointly determined by the quality of optical transmission of the eye and neural processing in the visual system. An open question is: Can effects of optical defects be compensated by perceptual learning in neural processing? To address this question, we conducted a perceptual learning study on 23 observers with myopic vision, targeting high frequency deficits by training them in a monocular grating detection task in the non-dominant eye near their individual cutoff spatial frequencies. The contrast sensitivity function and visual acuity in both eyes (without optical correction) were assessed for all the observers in the training group before and after training, and for all the observers in the control group twice with a 10-day interval between the tests. In addition, the threshold versus external noise contrast function was measured for five observers in the training group before and after training. We found that (a) training significantly improved contrast sensitivity at the trained spatial frequency, visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity over a wide range of spatial frequencies in both eyes; (b) training did not lead to any significant refractive changes; (c) the mechanism of improvements was a combination of internal additive noise reduction and external noise exclusion; and (d) the improvements in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity were almost fully retained for at least four months in the three observers tested. These results suggest that perceptual learning may provide a potential noninvasive procedure to compensate for optical defects in mild to modest myopia.},

The contrast sensitivity function (CSF), which measures visual sensitivity to spatial patterns over a wide range of spatial frequencies, provides a comprehensive characterization of the visual system. Despite its popularity and significance in both basic research and clinical practice, it hasn\&\#39;t been clear what determines the CSF and how the factors underlying the CSF change in different conditions. In the current study, we applied the external noise method and perceptual template model to a wide range of external noise and spatial frequency (SF) conditions, and evaluated how the various sources of observer inefficiency changed with SF and determined the limiting factors underlying the CSF. We found that only internal additive noise and template gain changed significantly with SF, while the transducer non-linearity and coefficient for multiplicative noise were constant. The 12-parameter model provided a very good account of all the data in the 200 tested conditions (86.5\%, 86.2\%, 89.5\%, and 96.4\% for the four subjects, respectively). Our results suggest a re-consideration of the popular spatial vision model that employs the CSF as the front-end filter and constant internal additive noise across spatial frequencies. The study will also be of interest to scientists and clinicians engaged in characterizing spatial vision deficits and/or developing rehabilitation methods to restore spatial vision in clinical populations.},

However, the CSF itself is determined by the gain profile and other processing inefficiencies of the visual system; it may be problematic to use the CSF as the gain profile in observer models. Here, we applied the external noise paradigm and the perceptual template model (PTM) to characterize several major properties of the visual system. With the external noise normalized gain profile, nonlinearity, and internal additive and multiplicative noises, the PTM accounted for 92.8\% of the variance in the experiment data measured in a wide range of conditions and revealed the major processing components that determine the CSF. Unlike the CSF, the external noise normalized gain profile of the visual system is relatively flat across a wide range of spatial frequencies. The results may have major implications for understanding normal and abnormal spatial vision.},

We found, in normal observers, attenuation of one eye's stimulus luminance with neutral density filters produces binocular phase combination similar to those of amblyopic subjects. Correspondingly, in amblyopic observers, reduction of the fellow eye's stimulus luminance produces binocular phase combination similar to those of normal subjects. These phenomena could be explained by an attenuated contribution of the filtered eye to the binocular phase percept due to reduced gain-control. The findings have major implications both for the study of binocular combination and for amblyopia treatment.},

	abstract = {Although human observers can perceive depth from stereograms with considerable contrast difference between the images presented to the two eyes (Legge \& Gu, 1989), how contrast gain control functions in stereo depth perception has not been systematically investigated. Recently, we developed a multipathway contrast gain-control model (MCM) for binocular phase and contrast perception (Huang, Zhou, Lu, \& Zhou, 2011; Huang, Zhou, Zhou, \& Lu, 2010) based on a contrast gain-control model of binocular phase combination (Ding \& Sperling, 2006). To extend the MCM to simultaneously account for stereo depth and cyclopean contrast perception, we manipulated the contrasts (ranging from 0.08 to 0.4) of the dynamic random dot stereograms (RDS) presented to the left and right eyes independently and measured both disparity thresholds for depth perception and perceived contrasts of the cyclopean images. We found that both disparity threshold and perceived contrast depended strongly on the signal contrasts in the two eyes, exhibiting characteristic binocular contrast gain-control properties. The results were well accounted for by an extended MCM model, in which each eye exerts gain control on the other eye's signal in proportion to its own signal contrast energy and also gain control over the other eye's gain control; stereo strength is proportional to the product of the signal strengths in the two eyes after contrast gain control, and perceived contrast is computed by combining contrast energy from the two eyes. The new model provided an excellent account of our data (r(2) = 0.945), as well as some challenging results in the literature.},

	abstract = {Perceptual learning, even when it exhibits significant specificity to basic stimulus features such as retinal location or spatial frequency, may cause discrimination performance to improve either through enhancement of early sensory representations or through selective re-weighting of connections from the sensory representations to specific responses, or both. For most experiments in the literature, the two forms of plasticity make similar predictions (Dosher \&amp; Lu, 2009; Petrov, Dosher, \&amp; Lu, 2005). The strongest test of the two hypotheses must use training and transfer tasks that rely on the same sensory representation with different task-dependent decision structures. If training changes sensory representations, transfer (or interference) must occur since the (changed) sensory representations are common. If instead training re-weights a separate set of task connections to decision, then performance in the two tasks may still be independent. Here, we performed a co-learning analysis of two perceptual learning tasks based on identical input stimuli, following a very interesting study of Fahle and Morgan (1996) who used nearly identical input stimuli (a three dot pattern) in training bisection and vernier tasks. Two important modifications were made: (1) identical input stimuli were used in the two tasks, and (2) subjects practiced both tasks in multiple alternating blocks (800 trials/block). Two groups of subjects with counterbalanced order of training participated in the experiments. We found significant and independent learning of the two tasks. The pattern of results is consistent with the reweighting hypothesis of perceptual learning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The first is using electrophysiological and brain imaging technique to investigate the functional specialization in disparity processing in the dorsal and ventral visual pathways, which reveals hierarchical and parallel processing principles in the visual system. The second is about learning-induced plasticity. Future research needs to combine brain imaging, neuromodulation and other cutting-edge techniques to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying binocular disparity, its learning effect, and the interaction between binocular disparity and other depth clues. On the application side, future research needs to optimize training paradigms (e.g., with virtual reality technique) for rehabilitation and enhancement in the binocular disparity performance.},

While auditory feedback just indicated the correctness of each response, full feedback included a tone to indicate correct response and a re-displayed grating of correct orientation, which provided complete information. The results showed that: 1) Thresholds decreased for all 6 groups as training proceeded; 2) External feedback prompt learning gradually with information carried by feedback increased; 3) Adding easy task (i.e. 70\% correct) improved performance significantly, showing the benefit of internal reward; 4) Interaction of external feedback and internal reward was observed in some but not all conditions, manifesting the flexibility of system employment of different information to optimize perceptual performance.

Dosher \&amp; Lu (2007) compared a number of functional forms for their ability to fit learning curves (reduced contrast thresholds in an orientation identification task) estimated from blocks of trials with a staircase procedure, and concluded that a single exponential function fit best. Recently, we showed that learning curves estimated from blocks of trials in staircase procedures are imprecise and may be biased, especially in fast learning situations (Zhang et al, 2019). A more detailed evaluation of the functional form of perceptual learning with trial-by-trial data is necessary. In this study, we developed a generative model in which the threshold in each trial is determined by the learning curve generated with a candidate functional form, the probability of a correct response reflects the trial-specific psychometric function, with the predicted response drawn from the Bernoulli distribution. The quality of fit was computed as the sum of the loglikelihood across the entire learning curve. Five candidate models (exponential, power, Apex, summed exponentials, cascade exponentials) were fit to the published experimental data from three perceptual learning tasks:  contrast detection (n=41; Zhang et al., 2018), Vernier offset discrimination (n=16; Zhang et al., 2018), and orientation identification (n=78; Liu, Dosher and Lu, 2010, 2012), using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC, Schwarz, 1978) for model selection. We found the preferences in pairwise comparisons are: (1) exponential 65.93\%, power 5.19\%, no preference 28.89\%; (2) exponential 96.30\%, Apex 3.70\%; (3) exponential 98.52\%, summed exponentials 1.48\%; and (4) exponential 83.70\%, cascade exponentials 14.81\%, no preference 1.48\%.

To better illustrate these characteristics, we developed a set of global orientation/motion judgment tasks of identical stimulus, measured subject's performance at two tasks of twenty-five orientation/motion coherence intensities, and trained subjects to report either orientation or motion direction with the other untrained dimension (i.e. motion or orientation) at four different coherence levels. Four groups were trained on a global orientation discrimination task for eight days and the coherence levels of zero, threshold at 63\% correct, threshold at 79\%, and suprathreshold coherence were assigned to the task-irrelevant feature (i.e. global motion) in each group. Similarly, another four groups trained on a motion direction discrimination task and exposed to four different orientation coherence levels. We found that (1) subjects' thresholds for the trained task improved significantly, mostly around the trained performance level; (2) learning outcomes at the trained dimension were irrespective of the exposed level of untrained dimension; (3) training with exposure to a certain coherence level of untrained dimension can almost fully generalize to the same task but with different levels of untrained dimension; (4) no significant improvement in motion direction task was observed when subjects were trained on orientation discrimination task, no matter to which motion coherence level they were exposed; (5) For motion direction learning groups, the learning effect could significantly but only slightly generalize to orientation tasks, which is also independent of the exposed orientation coherence level. No significant gain in both tasks was found in the control group. Our results suggest that perceptual learning may not result from the strengthened representation at early stage but depends on the involvement of multiple cortical areas and complex neural networks.

We developed an efficient procedure based on the qCSF (Lesmes, et al, 2010) to measure contrast sensitivity as functions of seven spatial frequencies (0.5{\textasciitilde}8 cpd) in three levels of external noise (white noise, μ=0 and σ∈[0 .08 0.24]) in young and old subjects. Using the perceptual template model (PTM) (Lu \&amp; Dosher, 2008), we decomposed contrast sensitivity into internal additive noise, internal multiplicative noise, template gain, and system non-linearity, and analyzed the mechanisms underlying CSF changes associated with aging. Five young (age: 23.6±0.8 yrs) and five old (age: 70±2.0 yrs) subjects, all without ophthalmological and mental diseases, participated in the experiment. We found that contrast sensitivity varied significantly with spatial frequency (F(6, 48)=43.316, p\&lt;0.001), level of external noise (F(2, 16)=227.05, p\&lt;0.001), and age (F(1, 8)=75.657, p\&lt;0.001). Nested model comparison revealed that only internal additive noise and the gain of the perceptual template varied significantly with spatial frequency in both groups. The model accounted for 89\% of the variance in the data. The template gain decreased significantly with aging (F(1, 8)=10.083, p\&lt;0.05), but the internal noise was comparable between the two groups (F(1, 8)=2.257, p\&gt;0.05). Our results suggest that aging decreases template gain but does not change internal noise in the visual system. Quick characterization of CSF at different noise levels and the accompanying analysis developed in the current study may have wide applications in other clinical populations.},

In the current study, we aimed to determine the effects of monocular training on a variety of binocular visual functions. Eleven adults with anisometropic amblyopia (22±1.4 yrs) were trained in a grating contrast detection task near each individual’s cutoff spatial frequency for 8 to 10 days, with 630 trials/day. Visual acuity, stereo acuity, monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) with the quick CSF method (Lesmes, et al., 2010), perceived phase of binocularly combined sinewave gratings as a function of interocular image contrast ratio (Huang et al., 2009), pAE dominance in viewing dichoptically presented incompatible images of equal contrasts were measured before and after training.\&lt;br /\&gt; Training substantially improved contrast sensitivity at the trained spatial frequency (by 75.4\%), area under the CSF (by 94\%), and visual acuity (logMAR from 0.62 to 0.42 or 2 lines) in the amblyopic eye. It also significantly improved stereo acuity (from 1530.9” to 110.7”) and increased the dominance duration of the amblyopic eye (from 2\% to 13\% in binocular rivalry). The improved dominance of the amblyopic eye was through elongation of each dominant phase without alteration of the switching frequency between the two eyes. On the other hand, training didn’t significantly improve the ratio of the areas under binocular and monocular fellow eye CSFs (from 1.1 to 1.08, p\&gt;0.1) and the interocular contrast ratio at which the two eyes contribute equally to binocular phase combination (from 0.11 to 0.13, p\&gt;0.10). There is no significant correlation between improvements in visual acuity, stereo acuity, and binocular rivalry.\&lt;br /\&gt; Although monocular training can improve visual acuity and contrast sensitivity and eye dominance of the amblyopic eye, the magnitudes of improvements didn’t correlate with each other; the impact on binocular summation and binocular phase combination was not significant. The results strongly suggest that structured monocular and binocular training is necessary to fully recover deficient visual functions in amblyopia.\&lt;br /\&gt;},

	abstract = {Sensitivity to luminance changes, or contrast sensitivity, is a fundamental visual function. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF), delineating contrast sensitivity over a wide range of spatial frequencies, provides a comprehensive characterization of spatial vision and a sensitive test for many physiological and pathological processes. Precise CSF measurements using the conventional psychophysical methods often take a long time and are impractical for clinical applications in special populations. In the current study, we tested whether the newly developed qCSF method (Lesmes, et al, 2010), taking about five minutes, can rapidly, reliably, and effectively evaluate CSFs in the aging population. Five young (age: 22.6±1.4 yrs) and eight old (age: 69.3±1.3 yrs) subjects participated in the experiment. All subjects had been screened for ophthalmological and mental diseases. They were tested using the conventional method that measures individual contrast thresholds in a number of spatial frequency conditions using the phi method (Kontsevich\&amp;Tyler, 1998), and the qCSF which combines Bayesian adaptive inference with an information gain strategy to directly estimate four parameters that defines the observer’s CSF. Our results showed that the CSF derived from the qCSF method well matched with that from the traditional phi method (young: F(1,4)=5.442, p\&gt;0.05); old:F(1,7)=1.462, p\&gt;0.10)and the test-retest reliability were exceptionally great(young:F(1,4)=1.329, p\&gt;0.10); old: (F(1,7)=0.297, p\&gt;0.10).More importantly, the qCSF method is sensitive to the CSF difference between the young and old groups (F(1,11)=9.714, p\&lt;0.01). Aging significantly degrades contrast sensitivity. TheqCSF method can reliably and effectively measure CSFs in the aging population.},

	abstract = {With abnormal visual cortical development, amblyopia is generally acknowledged as a spatial vision deficit in high spatial frequencies. The deficit may however reflect high internal noise rather than absence of cortical representation of high spatial frequency signal in amblyopia. To bypass the noise limitation, we measured supratheshold tilt aftereffects (TAE) following adaption to gratings of perceptually resolvable and unresolvable frequencies in subjects with amblyopia. Six anisometropic amblyopes (average age: 22.3±2.6 yrs; 2 females) participated in the study. Performance in grating orientation identification (tilted +15° or -15° from horizontal) was measured in eight spatial frequencies. The spatial frequencies of the adapting sinewave gratings were chosen for each observer based on performance in the orientation task. In general, 1 or 2 easily resolvable, 1 resolvable, and 2 to 3 unresolvable spatial frequencies were chosen for each observer. Observers were asked to judge the orientation of a 4 c/d test grating (clockwise or counter-clockwise from horizontal) following adaptation. Five test orientations were used in each adaptation condition based on results from pilot studies. TAE thresholds were estimated from these measurements. Adapting to gratings of resolvable spatial frequencies yielded an average TAE threshold of 1.35 ± 0.14° (Mean ± S.E.), consistent with previous reports in normal observers (He \&amp; MacLeod, 2001). What is surprising is that adapting to gratings of unresolvable spatial frequencies still yielded considerable TAE with an average effect size of 0.48 ± 0.07°. Although the TAE thresholds at unresolvable spatial frequencies were smaller than those at the resolvable spatial frequencies (t(28)=5.35, p \&lt;0.01), all the TAE thresholds were significantly greater than 0 (p\&lt;0.05). Averaged across observers, the ratio of the cutoff spatial frequencies in the TAE and traditional orientation identification tasks is 1.53 (± 0.08). Neural connections in the amblyopic cortex, at least in V1, may have profoundly developed to represent high spatial frequency information. The demonstration of extant neural connections for high spatial frequencies therefore unmasks improvement potentials and provides a strong theoretical basis for developing new therapies for amblyopia. Our paradigm may also serve as a non-invasive probe to diagnose the status of neural connections in other clinical conditions.},

	abstract = {We have two eyes but only see one world. How visual inputs from the two eyes combine in binocular vision has been one of the major focuses in basic and clinical vision research. Here, we combined the external noise approach with dichoptic displays to develop a binocular perceptual template model (bPTM) based on the perceptual template model (PTM; Lu \&amp; Dosher, 1999, 2008) and multi-pathway contrast-gain control model (MCM; Huang et al, 2010, 2011; Hou, et al, 2013).    The method of constant stimuli was used to measure psychometric functions in a sinewave grating detection task in two spatial frequencies (1, and 4 c/deg), three external noise levels (0, 0.125, and 0.25), seven contrast levels, and four dichoptic (grating and external noise in the left/right eye only; grating in the left/right eye, external noise in the right/left eye) and one binocular conditions (grating and external noise in both eyes). There were a total of 210 conditions and 18900 trials (90 trials/condition).    We found that the threshold versus external noise contrast function (TvC) in the four dichoptic conditions were virtually identical, and were only higher than that of the binocular condition in zero and low external noise conditions. The thresholds in the highest external noise conditions were virtually identical across all five display conditions. We propose a binocular perceptual template model that consists of monocular perceptual templates, non-linear transducer, and internal noises, interocular contrast-gain control, binocular summation, binocular internal noise, and decision process. The model is compatible with the original PTM in binocular conditions, and the MCM developed for suprathreshold phase and contrast combination and stereopsis (Hou, et al, 2011). With only five parameters, the bPTM provided an excellent account of all the data (r{\textasciicircum}2 \&gt; 90\%). With one additional parameter, the model can take into account of the imbalances between the two eyes in near threshold tasks, complementing the multi-pathway contrast gain control model in suprathreshold tasks.    The empirical results and bPTM shed new light on binocular combination and may provide the basis to investigate binocular vision in clinical populations.

	abstract = {Previously, we derived the signal gain and internal noise profiles in spatial vision as functions of spatial frequency through modeling the contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) measured in a range of external noise levels with the method of constant stimuli using a multi-channel perceptual template model (mPTM) (Chen et al., 2014; Hou, Lu, \&amp; Huang, 2014). Here, we extended and validated the qCSF method (Lesmes, et al., 2010) originally developed in zero external noise to measure CSF in multiple external noise conditions. The mPTM was used to extract the signal gain and internal noise profiles of spatial vision.    The CSFs of five normal observers in zero and high external noise conditions were measured in a 4AFC sinewave grating orientation identification task with the qCSF procedure and Ψ method (Kontsevich \&amp; Tyler, 1999). External noise was generated by filtering high contrast Gaussian white noise with a one-octave-wide raised cosine filter centered at the test grating spatial frequency. The mPTM, with both signal gain and internal noise profiles described by log parabola functions, was fit to the data.    We found that (1) Consistent with previous studies, the CSFs in the high external noise condition were virtually flat; (2) The CSFs obtained with the qCSF and Ψ methods were highly correlated in both external noise conditions (r = 0.95 ± 0.03); (3) The standard deviation of the CSFs obtained with 100 qCSF trials was 0.06 ± 0.01 and 0.07 ± 0.003 decimal log unit in the zero and high external noise conditions, respectively, with no significant difference between the two (p \&gt; 0.55). (3) The bias of the CSFs obtained with 100 qCSF trials was 0 ± 0.017 and 0.006 ± 0.041 decimal log unit in the two external noise conditions, with no significant difference (p \&gt; 0.75). (4) The mPTM accounted for 96.3 ± 2.0\% of the variance in the CSF data. The estimated signal gain profile was relatively flat. The magnitude of internal noise elevated with increasing spatial frequency.    The qCSF method can be extended to provide efficient, precise, and accurate measures of CSF in different external noise conditions. The CSFs obtained with 200 qCSF trials in zero and high external noise conditions can be used to reliably estimate the signal gain and internal noise profiles of spatial vision.

	abstract = {Technological advancements in virtual reality challenge the human vision, especially stereopsis, a function, which characterizes how two eyes coordinate to form a unified three-dimensional (3D) representation of the external world and is found to be deficient in 30\% of the normal population. Although a few previous studies have consistently found that the perceptual learning of stereopsis significantly improved stereoacuity, an underlying mechanism of stereo learning remains heavily debated. Here, we trained subjects with normal stereo vision (assessed with the FLY Stereo Acuity Test) to judge stereopsis containing three types of binocular disparity orders (i.e., zero-, first-, and second-order), aiming to systematically examine the characteristics and plasticity of stereo learning. Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to the three training groups (each for the zero-, first-, or second-order disparity separately). The disparity thresholds were measured before and after training. The disparity threshold was measured in 10 additional control subjects only at the pre- and post-training phase. Stereoscopic images were displayed through a shutter goggle, which is synchronized to a monitor. We found that the training significantly improved the zero-, first-, and second-order disparity threshold by 52.42, 36.28, and 14.9\% in the zero-order training condition; 30.44, 63.74, and 21.07\% in the first-order training condition; and 30.77, 25.19, and 75.12\% in the second-order training condition, respectively. There was no significant improvement in the control group. Interestingly, the greatest improvements in the first- and second-order disparity threshold were found in the corresponding disparity training group; on the contrary, the improvements in the zero-order disparity threshold were comparable across all the three disparity training groups. Our findings demonstrated both general (related to the zero-order disparity) and specific improvements (related to the first- and second-order disparity) in stereo learning, suggesting that stereo training occurs at different visual processing stages and its effects might depend on the specific training sites.},

	abstract = {Hypothesis testing about parameters of fitted models has been challenged by potential covariance between them. Here, we adopted the hierarchical Bayesian (HB) framework to model the parameter covariance in learning curves in perceptual learning, and test hypotheses about individual parameters for different conditions. Specifically, we analyzed data from Zhang et al (2018), who studied the effects of monetary reward on perceptual learning, comparing high, subliminal, block, low, or no reward.  In that study, a two-parameter power function (initial threshold and learning rate) was fit to the learning curve of each observer.  However, the covariance between parameters for initial thresholds and learning rates made it difficult to compare them across conditions. In this study, we constructed a hierarchical Bayesian model, in which five joint hyperparameter distributions of initial threshold and learning rate, one for each reward condition, were specified. The parameters of individual observers in each reward condition are drawn the corresponding hyper-distribution(s). The maximum likelihood was used to compute the distributions of the hyper parameters and parameters of each observer. We found that initial threshold and learning rate were positively correlated (ranging from 0.116 to 0.570). After controlling the covariance, ANOVA revealed that the initial thresholds and learning rates were both significantly different across the five reward conditions (all p=0). Post hoc multiple comparison found that the initial threshold was comparable among the high, no and low reward conditions, and between the no and block reward conditions. However, the learning rate was significantly different (α= 0.05) between all pairs except between the high and subliminal reward conditions. The method developed in this study can be generalized to conduct hypothesis testing about parameters of fitted models.},

	abstract = {The current gold standard of a successful amblyopia treatment is the full recovery of visual acuity in the amblyopic eye. Although anecdotal evidence suggests that other visual functions such as contrast sensitivity might still be deficient after full acuity recovery, there has been no systematic study on how the previously amblyopic eye (pAE) will behave in binocular vision. In this study, we aimed to quantify sensory dominance of the pAE in a group of treated amblyopia. Eight treated amblyopes with very similar acuity in the two eyes (logMAR: .03 vs .00) participated in this study. Stereoacuity, monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) with the quick CSF method (Lesmes et al., 2010), perceived phase of binocularly combined sinewave grating as a function of interocular contrast ratio (Huang et al., 2009), and pAE dominance in viewing dichoptically presented incompatible images of equal contrasts were measured. To quantify sensory eye dominance, we derived three different indices: (1) binocular contrast summation ratio: the ratio of the areas under binocular and previously fellow eye (pFE) CSFs, (2) balance point in binocular combination: the interocular contrast ratio at which the two eyes contribute equally to binocular phase combination, and (3) percentage of pAE dominance. The lower the binocular summation ratio and balance point, the weaker the pAE relative to the pFE is; a less than 0.5 eye dominance percentage indicates weaker pAE than pFE. Near stereo acuity (31.38”±6.93”) and pAE dominance percentage (.5 at 1 c/d and .43 at 8 c/d) of the treated amblyopes were largely comparable to those of normal subjects. Contrast sensitivity remained deficient in high spatial frequencies, consistent with Huang et al. (2007), although their binocular contrast summation ratio (1.26±0.16) is only slightly less than that of normal subjects (Baker et al. 2007). However, the average balance point in binocular combination was only 0.41---the effective contrast of images in the pAE is equal to about 41\% of the same contrast presented to the pFE in binocular phase combination. Although near stereoacuity, binocular contrast summation ratio, and eye dominance in treated amblyopia were normal or nearly normal, the pAE remained “lazy” in binocular phase combination. Our results suggest that structured monocular and binocular training are necessary to fully recover deficient functions in amblyopia.},

	abstract = {Although numerous studies have shown that perceptual learning can improve deficient visual functions in adults with amblyopia, the efficacy of perceptual learning in treating children with amblyopia has rarely been investigated. Here, we designed a child-friendly, individualized adaptive vision training (iAVT) based on a visual training procedure originally developed to train adults with amblyopia (Zhou, et al, 2006) to evaluate effects of perceptual learning in children with amblyopia.    Ninteen amblyopic children (7.78±2.73 yrs) were trained with the iAVT in a filtered letter E orientation identification task near their individual cutoff frequency for 8 sessions, with 300 trials or 30 minutes per session. Contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and visual acuity in both the amblyopic and fellow eyes, and stereo acuity were assessed before and after training. CSF was measured using the qCSF procedure (Lesmes, et al 2010). Each qCSF assessment took less than five minutes.    Training significantly improved visual acuity (2 lines) and contrast sensitivity (53.9\%, from 13.01 to 20.02, p\&lt; 0.0001) in the amblyopic eye, stereo acuity (80.8\%, from 606’’ to 116.2’’, p\&lt; 0.0001), and contrast sensitivity (24.7\%, from 28.4 to 35.4, p\&lt; 0.01) in the fellow eye. The magnitudes of improvements were correlated with pre-training visual deficits: The worse the pre-training measure was, the greater the improvements. Interestingly, we found no significant correlation among the magnitudes of improvements in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity (all p \&gt; 0.39).    These results demonstrate the merit of perceptual learning in treating children with amblyopia. Consistent with results in adults with amblyopia (Xi, et al 2014), the lack of correlation among improvements in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and stereo acuity suggests that structured monocular and binocular treatments are necessary to fully restore deficient visual functions in amblyopia.

	abstract = {Dichoptic training gained intense interest in recent amblyopia practice but evidence from latest clinical trials failed to endorse this idea. We hypothesized that the setting of previous dichoptic perceptual learning, which aimed at increasing the maximal tolerable noise (Strategy 1) in the fellow eye of amblyope, may intrinsically impeded the construction of normal binocular interaction since the fellow eye always received high contrast in daily life vision. Here we report the effect of an alternative training strategy (Strategy 2), whereby the amblyopic eye always received constant and high interocular inhibition from the fellow eye in two groups of participants with amblyopia.    Two groups of participants (n=14) with matched visual acuities and CSFs were included. Group 1 (n=7) were trained with strategy 2 for 7-9 days. Group 2 (n=7) were firstly trained with strategy 1 aiming at increasing the maximal tolerable noise contrast in the fellow eye (Liu et al, Vis Res, 2017) in the first phase and crossed over to the Strategy 2 in the second phase. Visual acuities, CSF with and without noise mask in the contralateral eye, stereo acuities were obtained before and after training. Dichoptic gain, defined as contrast threshold elevation under dichoptic viewing condition was used as an index of interocular inhibition.    Strategy 2 induced significant change of dichoptic gain averaged across three low spatial frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2 cpd) from 30.66±4.43 dB to 24.22±3.58 dB in Group 1 (P=0.026). In Group 2, Strategy 1 showed weak effect in changing dichoptic gain from 33.21±4.01 dB to 30.96±4.92 dB (P=0.05), while Strategy 2 further strengthened interocular cooperation by changing dichoptic gain to 25.44±6.38 during the second phase (P=0.02). Importantly, the strengthened dichoptic gain was accompanied with an improvement of monocular unmasked AULCSF in the amblyopic eye. Neither masked nor unmasked AULCSF in the fellow eye improved after perceptual learning.    We conclude that the enhancement of the amblyopic eye under natural environment may play a key role in dichoptic perceptual learning, and future design should not solely increase the tolerable noise in the fellow eye.
